# Photochop_haskell

This project was made with pvale94 and Inês. And the purpose was to 'Princípios de Programação', a subject of our Computer Science Course in Faculty of Sciences of the University of Lisbon.
It was pvale94 that managed most of the project.

This project was made so we could practise the things we learned in the classroom.
