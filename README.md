# Photochop_haskell

This project was made with pvale94, Inês and me. And the purpose was to 'Princípios de Programação', a subject of our Software Engineering course in Faculdade de Ciências da Universidade de Lisboa.

This project was made so we could practise functional programming and other things we learned in this subject.

Photochop is simple haskell program that does some photoshop features. :-)

# Compile
ghc --make main.hs -o photoshop

# Running tests

# Running quickCheck
